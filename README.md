README: Function and Recursion
This document provides an overview of the code functionalities and instructions for use.

Problems:

This code solves ten problems using recursion and array manipulation techniques. Each problem is addressed by a separate function.

Problem 1: Find the minimum element in an array.
Problem 2: Calculate the average of elements in an array.
Problem 3 (Recursive): Check if a number is prime.
Problem 4 (Recursive): Find the factorial of a number.
Problem 5 (Recursive): Calculate the n-th element in the Fibonacci sequence.
Problem 6: Calculate a raised to the power of n.
Problem 7 (Recursive): Print an array in reverse order without using additional array structures.
Problem 8: Check if a string consists only of digits.
Problem 9 (Recursive): Calculate the binomial coefficient (Cn k) using a recursive formula.
Problem 10 (Recursive): Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
